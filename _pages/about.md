I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA, studying pure mathematics and statistics. I am interested in machine learning/deep learning theory and understanding generalization phenomena of neural networks. I am privileged to work on problems in [benign overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting\#Benign_overfitting) and [grokking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokking_(machine_learning)) with Professor Guido Mont√∫far.

In my free time, I enjoy lifting, cooking, and reading manga!
